\textit Note: the manuscript was originally published with incorrect figure ordering. The correct figure order was published as a correction (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone. 0136128), but PLOS has decided to maintain the old manuscript with incorrect ordering online. The reprint below contains the corrected figure order. No other changes have been made to the online version.
